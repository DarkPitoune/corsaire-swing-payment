# SumUp mPOS SDK - Android

[![Platform](https://img.shields.io/badge/Platform-Android-brightgreen.svg?style=flat-square)](http://developer.android.com/index.html)
[![API](https://img.shields.io/badge/API-16%2B-orange.svg?style=flat-square)](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/android-4.1.html)

This repository provides a step by step documentation for SumUp's native Android SDK, that enables you to integrate our proprietary card terminal(s) and its payment platform to accept credit and debit card payments (incl. VISA, MasterCard, American Express and more). The SDK communicates transparently to the card terminal(s) via Bluetooth (BLE 4.0). Upon initiating a checkout, the SDK guides your user using appropriate screens through each step of the payment process. As part of the process, SumUp provides also the card terminal setup screen, along with the cardholder signature verification screen. The checkout result is returned with the relevant data for your records.

No sensitive card data is ever passed through to or stored on the merchantâ€™s phone. All data is encrypted by the card terminal, which has been fully certified to the highest industry standards (PCI, EMV I & II, Visa, MasterCard & Amex).

For more information about SumUp developer products, please refer to our <a href="http://docs.sumup.com/" target="_blank"> SumUp API documentation</a>.

   - Kotlin version 1.5.21 or later
   - Java 11 and later 

## I. Integrate the SumUp SDK

  * You can use the sample app provided in this repository as a reference


### 1. Dependency

Add the repository to your gradle dependencies:

```groovy
allprojects {
   repositories {
      maven { url 'https://maven.sumup.com/releases' }
   }
}
```


Add the dependency to a module:

```groovy
implementation 'com.sumup:merchant-sdk:4.0.0'
```


### 2. Initialization


Initialize the SumUp components in your app:

```java
	public class SampleApplication extends Application {
	
	@Override
	public void onCreate() {
		super.onCreate();
		SumUpState.init(this);
	}
```

### 3. Login
Before calling any features of the SumUp SDK, a registered SumUp merchant account needs to be logged in. Please go to https://me.sumup.com/developers to retrieve your Affiliate Key by entering the application ID of your app. (e.g. com.sumup.sdksampleapp)

```java
SumUpLogin sumupLogin = SumUpLogin.builder(mAffiliateKey).build();
SumUpAPI.openLoginActivity(MainActivity.this, sumupLogin, 1);
```

> Note: It is also possible to login an account with a token, without the user entering their SumUp login credentials in the SDK. Please refer to section [Transaction Authentication](#5-transparent-authentication)

### 4. Make a payment
Once logged in, you can start using the SumUp SDK to accept card payments. If no account is logged in, `SumUpAPI.Response.ResultCode.ERROR_NOT_LOGGED_IN` will be returned.

```java
    SumUpPayment payment = SumUpPayment.builder()
            // mandatory parameters
            .total(new BigDecimal("1.12")) // minimum 1.00
            .currency(SumUpPayment.Currency.EUR)
	    // optional: include a tip amount in addition to the total
	    .tip(new BigDecimal("0.10"))
            // optional: add details
            .title("Taxi Ride")
            .receiptEmail("customer@mail.com")
            .receiptSMS("+3531234567890")
            // optional: Add metadata
            .addAdditionalInfo("AccountId", "taxi0334")
            .addAdditionalInfo("From", "Paris")
            .addAdditionalInfo("To", "Berlin")
            // optional: foreign transaction ID, must be unique!
            .foreignTransactionId(UUID.randomUUID().toString())  // can not exceed 128 chars
	    // optional: skip the success screen
	    .skipSuccessScreen()
	    // optional: skip the failed screen
            .skipFailedScreen()
            .build();

    SumUpAPI.checkout(MainActivity.this, payment, 2);
```

### 5. Handle payment result
```java
   @Override
   protected void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data) {
      if (requestCode == 2 && data != null) {
         // Handle the response here
      }
   }
```


## II. Additional features

### 1. Response fields

The response flags are provided within the Bundle that is passed back to the callback activity:

```java 
 	int resultCode = getIntent().getExtras().getInt(SumUpAPI.Response.RESULT_CODE);
 ```

### 2. Payment settings

When a merchant is logged in, you can enable them to change their payment method settings, e.g. select and pair their preferred card terminal. The preferences available to a merchant depend on the individual merchant settings.

```java
 	SumUpAPI.openPaymentSettingsActivity(MainActivity.this, 3);
 ```

### 3. Card reader page

When a merchant is logged in, you can open this activity to access all the settings and options related to the card reader.
* This activity mainly offers
    * To be able to connect to a new card reader.
    * To be able to see the reader attributes when previously connected i.e. Battery percentage, Serial number, Last three digits of serial number, Software version.
    * Connect to the last saved reader if it is inactive.
    * Update firmware of the reader if available.
    * Visual illustration of the saved reader with it's current connectivity status and name.

```java
 	SumUpAPI.openCardReaderPage(MainActivity.this, 4);
 ```

### 4. Prepare the SumUp Card terminal in advance
To prepare a SumUp card terminal for checkout, a registered SumUp merchant account needs to be logged in and the card terminal will have been already setup. 
Calling `prepareForCheckout()` before instancing a checkout will speed up the checkout time.


### 5. Additional checkout parameters
When setting up the `SumUpPayment` object, the following optional parameters can be included:

#### Tip amount
A tip amount can be processed in addition to the `total` using the `tip` parameter. The tip amount will then be shown during the checkout process and be included in the response. Please note that a tip amount cannot be changed during/after the checkout.

#### Transaction identifier
The `foreignTransactionID` identifier will be associated with the transaction and can be used to retrieve details related to the transaction. See [API documentation](https://developer.sumup.com/rest-api/#tag/Transactions) for details. Please make sure that this ID is unique within the scope of the SumUp merchant account and sub-accounts. It must not be longer than 128 characters.
The foreignTransactionID is available when the callback activity is called: `SumUpAPI.Param.FOREIGN_TRANSACTION_ID`

#### Skip success screen
To skip the success screen shown at the end of a successful transaction, the `skipSuccessScreen` parameter can be used. When using this parameter  your application is responsible for displaying the transaction result to the customer. In combination with the Receipts API your application can also send your own receipts, see [API documentation](https://developer.sumup.com/rest-api/#tag/Receipts) for details. Please note success screens will still be shown when using the SumUp Air Lite readers.

#### Skip failed screen
To skip the failed screen shown at the end of a failed transaction, the `skipFailedScreen` parameter can be used. When using this parameter  your application is responsible for displaying the transaction result to the customer. Please note failed screens will still be shown when using the SumUp Air Lite readers.

### 6. Transparent authentication

To authenticate an account without the user typing in their SumUp credentials each time, you can generate an access token using OAuth2.0 and use it to transparently login to the SumUp SDK.

```java
SumUpLogin sumupLogin = SumUpLogin.builder(mAffiliateKey).accessToken("MY_ACCESS_TOKEN").build();
SumUpAPI.openLoginActivity(MainActivity.this, sumupLogin, 1);
```

For information about how to obtain a token, please see the [API Documentation](https://developer.sumup.com/docs/authorization).

If the token is invalid, `SumUpAPI.Response.ResultCode.ERROR_INVALID_TOKEN` will be returned.

### 7. Retrieve data of the current merchant account

If a merchant account is currently logged in, it is possible to retrieve the data for this account.

```java
	if (!SumUpAPI.isLoggedIn()) {
		// no merchant account currently logged in
	} else {
		Merchant currentMerchant = SumUpAPI.getCurrentMerchant();
	}
```

### 8. Log out SumUp account
 ```java
 	SumUpAPI.logout();
 ```


### 9. Enable ProGuard
```groovy
   buildTypes {
        release {
            // All ProGuard rules required by the SumUp SDK are packaged with the library
            minifyEnabled true
            proguardFiles getDefaultProguardFile('proguard-android.txt')
        }
    }
```

### 10. Use Google Location Services
       
The SDK supports Google Location Services, to improve location accuracy and reduce power consumption.

In order to use it you need to add the dependency in build.gradle file 
```groovy
implementation "com.google.android.gms:play-services-location:19.0.1"
```
       
If the GLS dependency is not added to the project or Google Play Services are not installed on the mobile device the SumUp SDK will determine the location with the default Location Service provided by Android.
       
> NOTE: Using GLS version 19.0.1 is recommended.

### 11. TargetSDK lower than 31
Even if the SumUp SDK is now set to targetSDK 31, backward compatibility to lower targetSDK is ensured. However, the following will be necessary to be added in the AndroidManifest.xml

```java
   <uses-permission
      android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_SCAN"
      tools:node="remove"/>

    <uses-permission
      android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_CONNECT"
      tools:node="remove"/>

    <uses-permission
      android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_SCAN" />

    <uses-permission
      android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_CONNECT" />
```

**WARNING**: Make sure to remove this block of code when raising your targetSDK to 31 and above!

### 12. Supporting Android API below 26
For Android SDK below 26, it is required to enable desugaring for Java 8+ API compatibility.

```groovy
android {
  compileOptions {
    coreLibraryDesugaringEnabled true
  }
}

dependencies {
  coreLibraryDesugaring "com.android.tools:desugar_jdk_libs:1.1.5"
}
```

### 13. Retain BLE Connection (Experimental)

It is possible to avoid BLE reconnection to a card reader after a transaction by calling the experimental method: `SumUpExperimentalAPI.prepareForCheckout(boolean retainBLEConnection)`.

This method can replace the usage of the existing `prepareForCheckout()` described in section 4 above, only if one needs to retain the BLE connection.

Retaining the BLE connection should improve the experience of Merchants as the card reader will remain connected after each transaction.

> Note : The behavior is only available for Air and Solo card readers
